Both of the states are absorbing/terminal.\n\nBy default, the reward is 0 when the gambler goes broke and +1 when it achieves the target capital. The difference from Ruin is that no reward received in the terminal state. The rewards for overall win and loss can be adjusted by providing win_reward and lose_reward optional parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MDPs.Domains.Inventory.Demand","page":"MDPs.jl: Markov Decision Processes","title":"MDPs.Domains.Inventory.Demand","text":"Models values of demand in values and probabilities in probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MDPs.Domains.Inventory.Model","page":"MDPs.jl: Markov Decision Processes","title":"MDPs.Domains.Inventory.Model","text":"An inventory MDP problem simulator\n\nThe states and actions are 1-based integers.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MDPs.Domains.Inventory.Parameters","page":"MDPs.jl: Markov Decision Processes","title":"MDPs.Domains.Inventory.Parameters","text":"Parameters that define an inventory problem\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MDPs.transition-Tuple{MDPs.Domains.Inventory.Parameters, Int64, Int64, Int64}","page":"MDPs.jl: Markov Decision Processes","title":"MDPs.transition","text":"transition(params, stock, order, demand)\n\nUpdate the inventory value and compute the profit.\n\nStarting with a stock number of items, then order of items arrive, after demand of items are sold.
